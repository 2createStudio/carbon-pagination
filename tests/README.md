2) Install WordPress and the WP Unit Test lib using the `install.sh` script. Change to the plugin root directory and type:

    $ tests/bin/install.sh <db-name> <db-user> <db-password> [db-host]

Sample usage:

    $ tests/bin/install.sh carbon_pagination_tests root root

**Important**: Make sure that the `<db-name>` database has been created. Note that all data will be removed during testing.
